# Day-4

Here's a breakdown of what I used and what it does:

Aggregate Functions:
I used functions like MAX, MIN, SUM, COUNT, and AVG to perform calculations on groups of data:

MAX and MIN help find the highest and lowest marks.

SUM adds up all the marks for a subject.

COUNT is used to find how many records (e.g., students) meet a condition.

AVG calculates the average score.

Filtering with WHERE Clause:
I used the WHERE condition to filter specific rows, such as finding how many students scored below 60 in math.

Grouping with GROUP BY:
I grouped data by student names to calculate per-student averages, treating each student as a group.

Filtering Groups with HAVING Clause:
I applied the HAVING clause to show only those students whose average marks in a subject (like English) are above a certain value.
